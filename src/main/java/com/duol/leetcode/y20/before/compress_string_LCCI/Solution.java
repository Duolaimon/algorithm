/**
 * 01.06
 * Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters.
 * For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2blc5a3.
 * If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string.
 * You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a - z).
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: "aabcccccaaa"
 * Output: "a2b1c5a3"
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: "abbccd"
 * Output: "abbccd"
 * Explanation:
 * The compressed string is "a1b2c2d1", which is longer than the original string.
 * Â 
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * 0 <= S.length <= 50000
 *
