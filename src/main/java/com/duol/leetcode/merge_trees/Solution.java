/**

 *
 * Given two binary trees and imagine that when you put one of them to cover the other,
 * some nodes of the two trees are overlapped while the others are not.
 *
 * You need to merge them into a new binary tree.
 * The merge rule is that if two nodes OVERLAP, then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node.
 * Otherwise, the NOT null node will be used as the node of new tree.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input:
 * 	Tree 1                     Tree 2
 *           1                         2
 *          / \                       / \
 *         3   2                     1   3
 *        /                           \   \
 *       5                             4   7
 * Output:
 * Merged tree:
 * 	     3
 * 	    / \
 * 	   4   5
 * 	  / \   \
 * 	 5   4   7
 * Â 
 *
 * Note: The merging process must start from the root nodes of both trees.
